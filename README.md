# TabletopDiceRoller

Tabletop Dice Roller is an Android application that allows users to simulate dice rolls, create a listing of favorited dice rolls, and view their rolling history.
The project is not currently finished but I will continue updating this repository as I update the app.
This app was created using Android Studio.
